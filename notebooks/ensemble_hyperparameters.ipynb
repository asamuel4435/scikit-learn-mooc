    "`learning_rate`, and `max_depth` or `max_leaf_nodes` (as previously discussed\n",

    "Let's first discuss `max_iter` which, similarly to the `n_estimators`\n",
    "hyperparameter in random forests, controls the number of trees in the\n",
    "estimator. The difference is that the actual number of trees trained by the\n",
    "model is not entirely set by the user, but depends also on the stopping\n",
    "criteria: the number of trees can be lower than `max_iter` if adding a new\n",
    "tree does not improve the model enough. We will give more details on this in\n",
    "the next exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The depth of the trees is controlled by `max_depth` (or `max_leaf_nodes`). We\n",
    "saw in the section on gradient-boosting that boosting algorithms fit the error\n",
    "of the previous tree in the ensemble. Thus, fitting fully grown trees would be\n",
    "detrimental. Indeed, the first tree of the ensemble would perfectly fit\n",
    "(overfit) the data and thus no subsequent tree would be required, since there\n",
    "would be no residuals. Therefore, the tree used in gradient-boosting should\n",
    "have a low depth, typically between 3 to 8 levels, or few leaves ($2^3=8$ to\n",
    "$2^8=256$). Having very weak learners at each step helps reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this consideration in mind, the deeper the trees, the faster the\n",
    "residuals are corrected and then less learners are required. Therefore,\n",
    "it can be beneficial to increase `max_iter` if `max_depth` is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have overlooked the impact of the `learning_rate` parameter\n",
    "until now. This parameter controls how much each correction contributes to the\n",
    "final prediction. A smaller learning-rate means the corrections of a new\n",
    "tree result in small adjustments to the model prediction. When the\n",
    "learning-rate is small, the model generally needs more trees to achieve good\n",
    "performance. A higher learning-rate makes larger adjustments with each tree,\n",
    "which requires fewer trees and trains faster, at the risk of overfitting. The\n",
    "learning-rate needs to be tuned by hyperparameter tuning to obtain the best\n",
    "value that results in a model with good generalization performance."
